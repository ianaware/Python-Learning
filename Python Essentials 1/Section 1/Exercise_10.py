'''

In the editor window you can see a very simple example of using a keyword argument.

In order to use it, it is necessary to know some rules:

a keyword argument consists of three elements: a keyword identifying the argument (end here); an equal sign (=); and a value assigned to that argument;
any keyword arguments have to be put after the last positional argument (this is very important)

In our example, we have made use of the end keyword argument, and set it to a string containing one space.

print("My name is", "Python.", end=" ")
print("Monty Python.")
